# Java-Brawl
first open-source brawl stars private server written in java! (and first open-source v23 private server!)
## some stuff you should read
thank you Icaro for OwnHomeDataMessage structure
I did the code entirely from scratch by myself
if you don't know java or don't know how to run it, please don't contact me.
if you want to learn from this project, feel free, just please don't ask me silly questions like 'how to run'
this is made as a good server base in java, you can implement other packets and a database by yourself
have fun ^^
# how2run
on android:
install Jvdroid, open pom.xml and run it.
on pc or others (basically anything that have java and maven installed in cmd):
- run in the same directory that have pom.xml
```
mvn package
```
- it will create a jar file, usually in target folder, use cd to reach it then run this command
```
java -jar JavaBrawl-1.0.jar
```
another option is using the [pre-compiled](https://github.com/SB-9838/Java-Brawl/pre-compiled/) jar file if you have java 11
